In this project, you'll build a simple Unix shell. The shell is the heart of the command-line interface, and thus is central to the Unix/C programming environment. Mastering use of the shell is necessary to become proficient in this world; knowing how the shell itself is built is the focus of this project.

There are three specific objectives to this assignment:

To further familiarize yourself with the Linux programming environment.
To learn how processes are created, destroyed, and managed.
To gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.
